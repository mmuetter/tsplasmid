# Questions

## Observation: when treating with B (Tet) A_r strains often come out as S when spotting.
  *Q: does tetracycline affect stability of pA?*
  
  Exp: e.g. 'Kill'-curve of A_r strains (ie. MG1655 (pA)) ('Kill' because tet is static) with plating on N, A plates

  using robot? -> simply grow up A_r strains, distribute in 384 well plate treated with b and spot every X min? (X = 30m, or 60m)

## Observation: no AB resistance in multidrug strategies

  - How & how often does AB resistance appear in no treatment?
      - do they appear when A and B is mixed, eg. when A is infected with b or *vice versa*?
      - do they always appear when that happens? immediately or is there a delay?
          - if there is some probability of appearance upon a 'mixing event' is this compatible with our observation?
            (ie. there are not enough 'mixing events' in the multidrug strategies?)
      - is what we see multiple appearance or 'just' spread of AB?
