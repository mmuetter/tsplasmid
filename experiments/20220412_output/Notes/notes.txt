#Â 12.04
Setup ran through without any issues except the end where the strainplate wasn't stamped

# 13.04
- storeX error at putting back by barcode test Strain Agarplate
	- In order to save time the test strain plate part was skipped
- The load worklist command wasn't correct (it referred to the old turnover.gwl instead of plate_i_turnover.gwl)
- The new turnover worklist wasn't entirely correct. 
	- The reservoir well should start for plate 1 with row C but it started with the "old well" in row F
	- This was because the gwl_pars.json wasn't up to date
	- both was fixed
- By putting back plates into the incubator multiple errors occurred. 
	- Experiment was recovered afterwards
- hopefully it runs stable until tomorrow
	- Plate 1 is done by now
# 14.04
- Script ran through. 
- Transfer 2 started
# 15.04
- Multiple problems:
	-  Script stopped at T2_plate 5 after OD reading. 
	- No specific reason, probably lost connection
	- Additionally one of the four pins was not correctly down
	- After restarting the robot the weird pintool offset problem occurred (pins don't match wells anymore)
	- exclude p5
- Pintool completely cleaned
- After additional restart offset disappeared
- Restarted complete transfer for plate 5 (Turnover, Infection, Transfer)
	- to make sure all wells are infected
	- Exclude this plate for Turnoverstatistics, since it contains the double amount of turnover bacteria
- One Lid Problem after plate 5. Roma realigned 
18.04
- No further problems in the last couple of days
- Returned Assay plate T3_P6: interesting well D1. 
	- Well is dark brown
	- Contamination?
	- Mutation?
	- P6 T4 seems to be uninfected
## 21.04
- Everything going smooth so far except:
	- Yesterday the StoreX had some plate read problems. resolved after restart
	- Strainplate T6 I14 uninfected 

## 25.04
- running smoothly except some Liha and StoreX hickups (not detecting liquid->Retry and barcode reading problems)
- Stupid user switched labels of ON13 with checkStrainplateN12 today... Therefore no check strainplates today. But having a look at the plate it looks like all wells are infected...

## 27.04
- observed during infection P2: On Pintool pin is not properly coming out
